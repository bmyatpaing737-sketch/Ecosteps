    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In the span of a single generation, plastic has transformed from a marvel of 
            modern chemistry into one of the most pressing environmental crises of our time. 
            Its versatility, low cost, and durability have led to its near-ubiquity, 
            particularly in the form of single-use products—items designed to be thrown away 
            after just a few minutes. We should reduce plastic use because
            it pollutes ecosystems, harms wildlife and human health, and worsens climate change, 
            with most plastic ending up in landfills or oceans, breaking down into harmful microplastics, 
            and polluting our food and water. Plastic production relies on fossil fuels, contributes to carbon 
            emissions, and despite recycling efforts, only a tiny fraction is actually recycled, making 
            reducing consumption crucial for environmental and health protection</p>

        <p>Plastic has become a part of almost everything we use—from water bottles and food packaging to shopping bags and household items. 
            While it is convenient, its long-lasting nature creates serious problems for the environment. 
           Plastic waste pollutes our oceans, harms wildlife, and contributes to climate change when it is burned or produced in huge amounts.</p>
